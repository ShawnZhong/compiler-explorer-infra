# CMake Compiler Cache Extraction Project

## Overview

This project provides a PowerShell script that extracts and packages CMake compiler cache files for reuse across projects. The script leverages CMake's own comprehensive compiler detection to create portable cache files that can significantly speed up CMake configuration by skipping expensive compiler detection phases.

## Key Benefits

- **Speed up CMake configuration** by skipping compiler detection phases
- **Avoid retesting** the same compiler across multiple projects
- **Portable cache files** that work across different projects
- **Comprehensive detection** using CMake's own logic (not custom version-specific code)
- **Support for both C and C++** compilers in a single pass
- **Cross-platform MSVC support** through Wine integration (Linux/macOS → Windows targets)

## Project Files

### Core Scripts
- `Extract-CMakeCache.ps1` - Main extraction script that generates reusable CMake cache files
- `CMake-Cache-Extraction-Guide.md` - Comprehensive usage guide and documentation
- `test-wine-msvc-full.sh` - Wine + MSVC test script with comprehensive debugging
- `wine-cl-wrapper.sh` - Wine wrapper for MSVC cl.exe with path conversion and compatibility fixes

### What the Script Does

1. **Creates a minimal CMake test project** with specified C/C++ compilers
2. **Runs CMake configuration** to trigger full compiler detection
3. **Extracts reusable cache components** from the generated build
4. **Sanitizes paths** to make cache files portable across projects
5. **Packages everything** into a convenient zip file for reuse

## Technical Background

### How CMake Compiler Detection Works

CMake performs several expensive operations during compiler detection:

1. **Compiler Identification** - Determines compiler type and version
2. **ABI Detection** - Tests compiler ABI compatibility  
3. **Feature Detection** - Tests which language features are supported
4. **Toolchain Discovery** - Finds associated tools (linker, archiver, etc.)

These steps involve:
- Compiling test programs (`CheckWorkingCompiler`)
- Running feature detection tests (`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES`)
- System introspection and tool discovery

### Cache Mechanism

CMake caches results in two key places:

1. **CMakeCache.txt** - User-visible cache variables
2. **CMakeFiles/{VERSION}/CMake{C,CXX}Compiler.cmake** - Detailed compiler info

The key to skipping detection is having both files with `CMAKE_PLATFORM_INFO_INITIALIZED:INTERNAL=1`.

### Why This Approach Works

- **MSVC uses version-based detection** rather than compilation tests for feature detection
- **Cache files are completely portable** when project-specific paths are removed
- **CMake's own detection logic** ensures comprehensive and accurate results
- **Version compatibility** is maintained by using CMake itself to generate cache

## Development History

### Problem Solved
Originally investigated how CMake on Windows instructs MSVC to compile test programs for compiler feature detection. Found that CMake uses different approaches:
- **MSVC**: Version-based feature detection (fast)
- **GCC/Clang**: Compilation-based feature detection (slower)

### Evolution of Solutions
1. **Manual Cache Generation**: Initially created scripts to manually generate cache files
2. **CMake-Generated Cache**: Evolved to let CMake do all the work and extract reusable parts
3. **C Language Support**: Extended to support both C and C++ compilers in single pass
4. **Wine + MSVC Integration**: Added cross-platform MSVC support through Wine with specialized wrapper and compatibility fixes

### Key Insights
- CMake stores compiler info in `CMakeCache.txt` (user variables) and `CMakeCXXCompiler.cmake` (detailed info)
- `CMAKE_PLATFORM_INFO_INITIALIZED:INTERNAL=1` is the key cache validation variable
- MSVC feature detection is version-based, making cache reuse very effective
- Cache files are portable when project-specific paths are sanitized

## Prerequisites

### Basic Requirements
- **PowerShell Core** (pwsh) - Cross-platform PowerShell 6.0+
- **CMake** 3.10 or later
- **C and/or C++ Compiler** (MSVC, GCC, Clang, etc.)

### Wine + MSVC Requirements (Linux/macOS)
- **Wine** - Windows compatibility layer (wine package)
- **MSVC Compiler** - Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (cl.exe)
- **Windows SDK** - Windows development headers and libraries
- **CMake for Windows** - Windows version of CMake (cmake.exe)

## Performance Impact

Typical time savings per project configuration:
- **Small projects**: 0.2-0.5 seconds saved
- **Large projects**: 1-3 seconds saved  
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Cumulative savings across multiple builds
- **Docker builds**: Faster layer rebuilds when only source changes

## Compatibility

- ✅ **CMake**: 3.10+ (tested with 3.28+)
- ✅ **Compilers**: MSVC, GCC, Clang, Apple Clang
- ✅ **Platforms**: Windows, Linux, macOS
- ✅ **PowerShell**: 6.0+ (PowerShell Core)
- ✅ **Languages**: C and C++ (individually or together)
- ✅ **Wine + MSVC**: MSVC 14.40+ running through Wine on Linux/macOS

## Best Practices

1. **One cache per compiler/version combination**
2. **Regenerate when compiler updates**
3. **Include compiler flags in cache generation**
4. **Store cache in version control for team consistency**
5. **Use in CI/CD for consistent build environments**

## Wine + MSVC Setup

### What is Wine + MSVC Support?

This project includes experimental support for running Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compilers through Wine on Linux and macOS systems. This allows you to generate MSVC cache files on non-Windows platforms.

### Wine + MSVC Components

The Wine + MSVC support includes several specialized components:

#### 1. `wine-cl-wrapper.sh` - MSVC Compatibility Wrapper
- **Path Translation**: Converts Unix paths to Windows paths for Wine
- **Argument Conversion**: Translates GCC-style `-o` flags to MSVC's `/Fo` flags
- **Object File Handling**: Manages `.o` vs `.obj` extension differences
- **Environment Setup**: Configures MSVC include and library paths

#### 2. `test-wine-msvc-full.sh` - Comprehensive Test Script
- **Environment Validation**: Checks for required MSVC, SDK, and CMake components
- **Wine Configuration**: Sets up Wine prefix and environment variables
- **Compiler Testing**: Validates basic MSVC compilation through Wine
- **Cache Extraction**: Runs full CMake cache generation process
- **Debug Output**: Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Temp Directory Preservation**: Keeps build artifacts for analysis

### Technical Challenges Solved

#### Path Translation
- **Unix ↔ Windows**: Seamless path conversion using `winepath`
- **Relative vs Absolute**: Proper handling of both path types
- **CMake Integration**: Transparent operation with CMake's build system

#### MSVC Compatibility
- **Flag Translation**: `-o output.o` → `/Fo output.obj`
- **Extension Handling**: Creates `.o` symlinks for `.obj` files as needed
- **Linking Support**: Handles both compilation and linking phases

#### Environment Management
- **Include Paths**: MSVC headers + Windows SDK headers
- **Library Paths**: MSVC libraries + Windows SDK libraries
- **Tool Discovery**: Automatic detection of compiler and SDK versions

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Wine + MSVC Cache Generation
```bash
# Ensure Wine and MSVC are available
./test-wine-msvc-full.sh
```

#### Manual Cache Generation with Wine + MSVC
```bash
# Set up Wine environment manually
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine-msvc"
export WINEARCH="win64"

# Configure MSVC paths (adjust to your installation)
export CC="/path/to/wine-cl-wrapper.sh"
export CXX="/path/to/wine-cl-wrapper.sh"
export CFLAGS="/std:c17 /nologo"
export CXXFLAGS="/std:c++17 /nologo"

# Generate cache
pwsh Extract-CMakeCache.ps1 -KeepTempDir
```

### Debugging Wine + MSVC Issues

#### Enable Debug Output
```bash
export WINE_CL_DEBUG=1
./test-wine-msvc-full.sh
```

#### Preserve Temporary Directories
The test script automatically preserves temporary directories for analysis when using `-KeepTempDir`.

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Compiler Not Found**
   - Verify MSVC installation paths in the wrapper script
   - Check Wine prefix configuration

2. **Linking Failures**
   - Object file extension mismatches (`.o` vs `.obj`)
   - Missing Windows SDK libraries

3. **Path Problems**
   - Unix paths not being converted to Windows format
   - Relative path resolution issues

### Performance Characteristics

Wine + MSVC cache generation is slower than native compilation but provides these benefits:

- **Cross-platform MSVC support**: Generate Windows caches on Linux/macOS
- **CI/CD Integration**: Include Windows targets in Linux-based pipelines
- **Development Flexibility**: Test Windows compatibility without Windows VMs

### Limitations

- **Performance**: Slower than native compilation due to Wine overhead
- **Compatibility**: Not all MSVC features may work perfectly through Wine
- **Setup Complexity**: Requires proper Wine + MSVC + SDK configuration

## Security Notes

- Cache files contain only compiler and system information
- No source code, project paths, or sensitive data included
- Safe to share across team members with same compiler setup
- Consider using separate caches for different security contexts
- Wine + MSVC setups may expose additional attack surfaces
